##Responsive Elements
Responsive elements makes it possible for any element to adapt and respond to the area they occupy. It's a tiny javascript library that you can drop into your projects today.

###Example

###Usage

####1. Load jQuery and `responsive-elements.js` right before your closing `</head>` tag

```html
<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="responsive-elements.js"></script>
```

####2. Explicitly declare which elements you want to be responsive using a data-respond attribute

```html
<div class="quote" data-respond>
```

####3. Use 'less than' and 'greater than' classes as breakpoints to write responsive CSS
```css
.quote.v-lt500 {background: blue}
.quote.v-gt150.v-lt300 {background: red}
```

####4. Optionally declare start, end and interval values on your `data-respond` attribute to control breakpoint generation
```html
<div class="quote" data-respond="start: 100px; end: 900px; interval: 50px;">
```
- Start: What pixel value should breakpoint generation start at
- End: What pixel value should breakpoints end at
- Interval: How many pixels between breakpoints
